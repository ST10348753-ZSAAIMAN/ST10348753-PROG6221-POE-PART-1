## App Functionality and How To Use It
The Recipe Application is a console-based tool designed to help users create, manage, and display recipes. Here's how you can use each of its features:

### Creating a Recipe
1. **Start the Application**: Run the application using the command line by navigating to the application directory and typing `dotnet run`.
2. **Enter Recipe Name**: Upon launch, the application will prompt you to enter the name of the recipe.
3. **Add Ingredients**:
   - The application will ask how many ingredients you want to add.
   - For each ingredient, you will need to specify the name, quantity, and unit of measurement. Enter each detail separated by a space (e.g., Sugar 2 cups).
4. **Add Preparation Steps**:
   - Next, you will specify how many preparation steps are involved.
   - Enter each step one at a time when prompted. The steps are numbered automatically.

### Editing a Recipe
Once a recipe is created, you can modify it using the following options:
- **Display Recipe**: Prints the current state of the recipe to the console, including all ingredients and steps.
- **Scale Recipe**: Allows you to scale the quantities of ingredients. You will be prompted to enter a scaling factor (e.g., to double the recipe, enter `2`).
- **Reset Recipe**: Resets all ingredient quantities to their original values.
- **Clear Recipe**: Clears all ingredients and steps from the recipe, allowing you to start fresh.

### Exiting the Application
- To exit the application, follow the prompts to navigate back to the main menu and choose the exit option.

### Navigational Tips
- The application uses simple text commands and prompts to navigate through the recipe creation and editing process.
- At any point, if you make a mistake in entry, the application will notify you and often allow you to re-enter the correct information.

This intuitive interface makes it easy to manage recipes without needing complex interactions, making it ideal for users of all technical levels.
